## Game
Once a game starts, a random player is picked to go first.
On your turn, you can play a number of cards in any order with a maximum of:
- 1 biome card

You can play cards except for biome cards in any lane.

When a **weapon/tool** card is placed in a lane, it automatically moves forward. If there is a **mob** in front of the weapon/tool, then it will damage the mob. If there is a block in the way, then it will damage the block. If the block or mob is not dead, the the weapon/tool will stop and be returned to your inventory. The weapon/tool will keep moving through the lane until it either runs out of durability, fails to kill a block or mob, or reaches the end of the lane, in which it damages the opponent.

You can place mobs anywhere within your half of the arena. A mob will generally attack when an enemy mob is in front of it.

You can place blocks anyway or spawn structures as long as you have the right card.

### Example
If a **Wooden Sword** is placed in **Lane 1**, it will continuously travel down that lane until it encounters an obstacle:

1.  If it hits a **block**, it will deal damage based on its attack power.
2.  If the block is destroyed, the sword continues moving down the lane.
3.  If the sword reaches a **mob** (like a chicken), it deals damage. If the mob survives, the sword stops there; if the mob is defeated, the sword continues until it reaches its durability limit.

## Card Properties
#### 1. **Weapons/Tools (Swords, Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes)**

These are your offensive cards that move through lanes and deal damage. Here are key properties:

-   **Durability**: How many hits the weapon can deliver before breaking.

    -   **Example**: A **Wooden Sword** has 3 durability points (can hit 3 times before breaking).
-   **Damage**: How much damage the weapon does per hit.

    -   **Example**: A **Wooden Pickaxe** might deal **2 damage** to mobs or blocks.
-   **Special Abilities**: Tools have additional effects depending on their type.

    -   **Axes**: Deal **bonus damage** to **wooden blocks or structures**.
    -   **Pickaxes**: **Break** stone-type blocks faster.
    -   **Shovels**: Quickly remove **dirt**-based blocks.
-   **Enchantments**: These add extra power to weapons. Examples:

    -   **Sharpness**: Increases damage.
    -   **Unbreaking**: Reduces the chance of losing durability.
    -   **Fire Aspect**: Causes mobs to take **burn damage** over time.

#### 2. **Mobs**

Mobs defend the playerâ€™s area by attacking weapons or enemy mobs. They can also attack into lanes. Key properties include:

-   **Health**: How much damage the mob can take before dying.

    -   **Example**: A **Zombie** might have **5 health points**.
-   **Attack Power**: The amount of damage a mob deals when attacking an enemy in its lane.

    -   **Example**: A **Spider** might deal **2 damage** each turn to any sword moving in its lane.
-   **Range**: Determines if a mob can attack from a distance (e.g., Skeletons can shoot **arrows** into lanes).

-   **Special Abilities**: Some mobs have special mechanics.

    -   **Creeper**: Explodes, dealing **area damage** to all nearby cards.
    -   **Slime**: Splits into smaller slimes when defeated, staying on the field.
    -   **Enderman**: Can **teleport** to avoid damage and move to a different lane.

#### 3. **Blocks/Structures**

Blocks act as defensive barriers, while structures may provide bonuses or effects. Key properties:

-   **Health/Durability**: How much damage the block or structure can take before being destroyed.

    -   **Example**: A **Dirt Block** has **2 health points**, while an **Obsidian Block** might have **20 health points**.
-   **Material Type**: Different blocks interact with tools uniquely.

    -   **Wooden Blocks**: Take more damage from **axes**.
    -   **Stone Blocks**: Are weak against **pickaxes**.
-   **Special Effects**: Structures could give players buffs or affect the battlefield.

    -   **Furnace**: Heals mobs in nearby lanes (mimicking cooking).
    -   **Redstone Mechanisms**: Could trigger traps, like **dispensers** shooting arrows down lanes.

#### 4. **Biome Cards**

Biome cards modify the overall battlefield, affecting entire lanes or specific areas. These cards create additional layers of strategy.

-   **Environmental Effects**:
    -   **Desert Biome**: Weapons lose durability faster due to the harsh environment.
    -   **Swamp Biome**: Mobs move slower in swamp lanes.
    -   **Snow Biome**: Slows down **all** weapon movement across all lanes.
-   **Buff/Debuff Effects**: Some biomes may provide bonuses or penalties to certain card types.
    -   **Jungle Biome**: Boosts health regeneration for mobs.
    -   **Nether Biome**: Increases **fire-based damage** for enchanted weapons like Fire Aspect swords.
